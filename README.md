This is a sample of a Centered CollectionView Flow Layout, that is in detail explaing in my blog post here.

The result of the layout looks like:

## Usage
Just initialize the `UICollectionViewCenterLayout` object and set it as the `collectionViewLayout` of your `UICollectionView`:

```swift
let layout = UICollectionViewCenterLayout()
layout.contentStyle = .left
layout.estimatedItemSize = CGSize(width: 140, height: 40)
collectionView.collectionViewLayout = layout
```
